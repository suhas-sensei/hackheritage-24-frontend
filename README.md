# Health Data Information & Management System (HDIMS)

## Project Overview

The *Health Data Information & Management System (HDIMS)* is a mobile application designed to streamline the collection, entry, and management of health data from hospitals and health departments. This application enables real-time updates, efficient reporting, and centralized visibility for the *Super Admin* to monitor, implement, and provide insights for health programs and schemes.

The HDIMS app provides a robust data flow from facility level to sub-district, district, and state/union territory levels, supporting data-driven decision-making for healthcare policy formulation and interventions. The system also aims to enhance transparency, equity, and efficiency in healthcare management.
